This project has been updated since A2 with an API for posts (index, show).

Instructions:
Boot up laravel project and seed mongoDB database with fake users and posts. 
Use ReactJS project to interact with server API (https://github.com/palse77/Brendan_Passey_A3_cosc360)
The ReactJS client side uses http://myblog.test/api URL to fetch data. Works great on my local machine.
